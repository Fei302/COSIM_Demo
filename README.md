# COSIM_Demo

# Purpose of Project
The goal of COSIM is to provide CO estimations at intersections in the worst case scenario. It boils down to the user providing the traffic situation they want to model, sending that for calculation, and outputting the CO estimations.

# Main Program Flow
1. Select the "GEN", next to the print button, to begin putting in inputs into the three general input pages 
- Fill out the three Gen input pages.
- These pages outline the district, intersection surrounding, project name, and other general inputs needed.
- When the third page is finished, select "Finish" in the bottom right to complete the "GEN" section.
3. After finishing the "GEN" input pages, the four "INT" input pages should be accessible. Click on it to continue the program.
- Fill out the four Int input pages.
- These pages outline all the data needed to simulate the intersection.
- When the fourth page is finished, select "Finish" in the bottom right to complete the "INT" section.
4. After finishing the "INT" input pages, the final "REC" input pages should be accessible. Click on it to continue the program.
- Fill out the single Receptor input page.
- This page outlines the location of where to put the receptors, the things that actually calculate/Simulate the CO, at.
- When the page is finished, select "Finish" in the bottom right to complete the "REC" section.
5. Finally, select the "CALC" button to send the inputs to the backend, and get the simulated CO emission in the worst case scenario after some waiting.
6. Save the final report, if needed, or make comments on it as needed.
